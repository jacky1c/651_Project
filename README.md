# Big Data Analysis Using Distributed Machine Learning

## Description
In this project, we propose the application of different machine learning methods over distributed computing platforms and hire a massive used car transaction dataset as an instance to perform the whole process of big data analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and machine learning modeling using Spark and Spark ML. Specifically, in the proposed system, all the null values are imputed in one dataset and the results are compared with another non-imputed dataset. In categorical data conversion, one-hot encoding is used to represent the feature availability. Finally, we evaluated our method quantitatively and qualitatively and discussed the pros and cons of each technique involved. By practicing the manipulation of the massive dataset on distributed computing platform, this project not only serves the future learners as a comprehensive guide to distributed machine learning and big data analysis, but also provides buyers and sellers with a tool to better estimate the value of a used car and delivery data-driven decisions.
